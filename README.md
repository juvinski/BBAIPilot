This project is based on the work of Mirko Denecke (https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI/).
BBBMini is a cape allowing run ardupilot on a Beaglebone black.
BBAIPilot is a cape allowing run ardupilot on a BeagleBone AI.

On this first phase we are adapting ardupilot code to run on BBAI using the sabe BBBMini cape.

11/06/2021 - First flight.
           - This first flight was really good - I ran with ardupilot the ssd_multibox sample and everything has worked fine. Now I will save the videos and detections to check the performance and how both (ardupilot and ssd_multibox) will produce running together.
